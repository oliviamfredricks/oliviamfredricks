				<h2>Trolli Strawberry Puffs</h2>

					These have a powerful strawberry flavor. Still chemical, obviously-not-derived-from-actual-strawberries strawberry flavor.

					Picked these up en route to Nashville after dropping off all of my belongings in Philly. It was some small, country, wooden shack of a gas station in the middle of nowhere that had a surprising assortment of gummies, including a very stale Trolli special edition Michael Jordan gummy shoes. All the other people in this gas station were maskless and white.

					Very shortly after opening this bag of candy, we were back on the road and getting pulled over for driving 81 in a 75. The man who took my partner's liscence and registration was suprisingly soft spoken for a cop. He was a pink-cheeked ginger and had the intonation of a dainty country boy. Strawberry cop.

					I think my little sister had a strawberry shortcake doll with the same creamy fake smell of this candy. We had the early-2000s Strawberry shortcake cartoon remake on dvd along with some pillowcases and maybe a sleeping bag. One of my brothers liked watching the show. He was relentlessly teased for it in our conservative, emotionally-stunted family.

					I didnâ€™t eat the whole bag and left a few in there when I got out of the car. They melted the next day into a big amorphous blob that I straight up scraped off of the inside of the bag with my teeth. It still tasted so good.
